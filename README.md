# Shell utilities

Shell utilities for everyday tasks


## Installation

Run `./install`, it will guide you through installation of all features.

 It is a script interpreted by Python 2.7 (by hashbang: `#!/usr/bin/env python`). If your Python path is different, just run `python install`.


## Features

### .bash_profile

Custom shell profile that shows current working directory and git branch on the right. Command is entered after a newline, so there is always plenty space for text there. Looks following:
